    <h2>Questionnaires</h2>

    <p>The application uses JSON files to define the details and structures of questionnaires. This section details how
      you can write your own questionnaire files for participants to take.</p>

    <p>The questionnaire files will comprise pairs of <i>properties</i> and <i>values</i>. These will need to be entered
      manually.</p>

        Example of a questionnaire.
      </figcaption>

      <pre>
        <code>
{
  "name": "Psychology Introduction",
  "questions": [
    {
      "id": "transference",
      "text": "How would you define the term 'transference'?",
      "type": "free-form"
    },
    {
      "id": "instincts",
      "text": "True or false: our instincts determine how we behave.",
      "type": "single-select",
      "options": [
        "True",
        "False"
      ],
      "answer": "True",
      "points": 2,
      "required": true
    }
  ]
}
        </code>
      </pre>
    </figure>

    <p>There are also additional properties and values that are not kept in the files themselves, but instead
      automatically generated for you.</p>

    <h3>Details</h3>

    <p>The application currently supports the following details:</p>

    <div class="table-container">
      <table>
        <caption>Properties and values used in questionnaires.</caption>
  
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Detail</th>
            <th>Property Name</th>
            <th>Value</th>
            <th>In File</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
  
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>ID</td>
            <td><code>id</code></td>
            <td>Short ID (string)</td>
            <td>No (automatically generated)</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Name</td>
            <td><code>name</code></td>
            <td>Questionnaire title (string)</td>
            <td>Yes</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Questions</td>
            <td><code>questions</code></td>
            <td>Questions to include (array of question objects)</td>
            <td>Yes</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </div>

    <p>At minimum, it is recommended that questionnaire files include a <code>name</code> property with which to
      identify them. However, if this is omitted, they will simply be referred to as 'Untitled Questionnaire'.</p>

    <p>If the <code>questions</code> array is omitted or left empty, the questionnaire cannot be taken.</p>

    <h3>Questions</h3>

    <p>The application currently supports the following question types:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Free-form questions</li>
      <li>Likert scale questions</li>
      <li>Number questions</li>
      <li>Multi-select questions</li>
      <li>Single-select questions</li>
      <li>Text questions</li>
    </ul>

        </tbody>
      </table>
    </div>

    <p>The <code>id</code>, <code>text</code>, and <code>type</code> properties are required for all question types. The
      <code>options</code> property is required for <i>likert scale</i>, <i>multi-select</i>, and <i>single-select</i>
      questions.</p>

    <p>To make scored questions, such as for quizzes, use the <code>answer</code> property. The question will be scored
      and
      will default have 1 point available for participants to gain. To optionally assign a different number of available
      points, use the <code>points</code> property.</p>

    <p>To require participants to answer a specific question, use the <code>required</code> property.</p>

    <h4>Free-Form Questions</h4>

    <p>Free-form questions will create a textarea field. These are generally useful for
      alphanumeric answers of any length, such as paragraphs.</p>

    <figure>
      <figcaption>
        Example of a text question.
      </figcaption>

      <pre>
        <code>
{
  "id": "wex",
  "text": "How would you describe your experience working in our call centre?",
  "type": "free-form"
}
        </code>
      </pre>
    </figure>

    <h4>Likert Scale Questions</h4>

    <p>Likert scale questions will create a single row of radio buttons. These are generally useful for ratings with
      five to seven points.</p>

    <p>Likert scale questions are defined using an array of options, which will create labels for each radio button from
      left to right.</p>

    <figure>
      <figcaption>
        Example of a Likert scale question.
      </figcaption>

      <pre>
        <code>
{
  "id": "skills",
  "text": "Please rate your skills on a scale of 1 to 5.",
  "type": "likert",
  "options": [
    "Poor (1)",
    "Fair (2)",
    "Good (3)",
    "Very good (4)",
    "Excellent (5)"
  ]
}
        </code>
      </pre>
    </figure>

    <h4>Number Questions</h4>

    <p>Number questions will create a single number input field. These are generally useful for storing amounts or
      numbers that can be rounded.</p>

    <figure>
      <figcaption>
        Example of a number question.
      </figcaption>

      <pre>
        <code>
{
  "id": "languages",
  "text": "How many languages can you speak?",
  "type": "number"
}
        </code>
      </pre>
    </figure>

    <h4>Multi-Select Questions</h4>

    <p>Multi-select questions will create rows of checkboxes. These are generally useful for lists of options, of which
      multiple can be selected.</p>

    <p>Multi-select questions are defined using an array of options, which will create labels for each checkbox from top
      to bottom.</p>

    <figure>
      <figcaption>
        Example of a multi-select question.
      </figcaption>

      <pre>
        <code>
{
  "id": "features",
  "text": "Which operating systems have you used before?",
  "type": "multi-select",
  "options": [
    "Windows",
    "MacOs",
    "Linux",
  ]
}
        </code>
      </pre>
    </figure>

    <h4>Single-Select Questions</h4>

    <p>Single-select questions will create rows of radio buttons. These are generally useful for lists of options, of
      which only one can be selected.</p>

    <p>Single-select questions are defined using an array of options, which will create labels for each radio button
      from top to bottom.</p>

    <figure>
      <figcaption>
        Example of a single-select question.
      </figcaption>

      <pre>
        <code>
{
  "id": "fatigue",
  "text": "Do you suffer with fatigue?",
  "type": "single-select",
  "options": [
    "Yes",
    "No"
  ]
}
        </code>
      </pre>
    </figure>

    <h4>Text Questions</h4>

    <p>Text questions will create a single text input field. These are generally useful for short alphanumeric answers.
    </p>

    <figure>
      <figcaption>
        Example of a text question.
      </figcaption>

      <pre>
        <code>
{
  "id": "company",
  "text": "What is your company's name?",
  "type": "text"
}
        </code>
      </pre>
    </figure>

    <h3>Adding Questionnaires</h3>

    <p>To add a questionnaire, click the <i>Add Questionnaire</i> button on the <a href="/">home page</a>. This will
      open an upload dialog. You can then upload your questionnaire file(s) by either:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>dragging and dropping the file(s) into the upload dialog</li>
      <li>selecting the file(s) on your device, using the file input and upload button</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Deleting Questionnaires</h3>

    <p>You can delete your questionnaires by clicking their respective <i>Delete</i> button shown on the <a
        href="/">home
        page</a>.</p>

    <p class="warning">
      Please note that questionnaires cannot be recovered once they have been deleted. It is recommended that you
      back up your questionnaire files in case you need to revert back to them.
    </p>

    <h3>Sharing Questionnaires</h3>

    <p>You can share links to your questionnaires to recruit participants and gather responses. To share a
      questionnaire, simply click its respective <i>Share</i> button on the <a href="/">home
        page</a>.</p>

    <p>When sharing, you may see one of two dialogs depending on your browser and device:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>native sharing dialog (typically on mobiles)</li>
      <li>default sharing dialog</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Both will allow you to copy a link to your questionnaire, although the former may give you other options such as
      sending via email or through a messaging application (but this is device-specific).</p>

    <p>Participants can also share your questionnaires after taking them, making it even easier to gather more
      responses.</p>

  <section id="responses-help">
    <h2>Responses</h2>

    <p>When a participant takes one of your questionnaires, their answers are collated to form a response for that
      questionnaire. This response is stored, and you can then view the response.</p>

    <p>To view a response, go to /review/<i>ID</i>, where <i>ID</i> is the short ID of the questionnaire for which you
      want to view responses.</p>

    <p>Alternatively, you can click on the <i>Review</i> link of your questionnaires on the <a href="/">home page</a>
    </p>

    <h3>Viewing Responses</h3>

    <p>When on the review page, you will be able to view the responses recorded for your questionnaire via two tab
      pabels:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The <i>Aggregrated</i> view, showing a summary of all responses by question</li>
      <li>The <i>Individual</i> view, showing responses one-by-one</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Downloading Responses</h3>

    <p>When on the review page, you will be able to download responses by clicking the <i>Download Responses</i> button.
      At present, the following structured file formats are available:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>CSV (.csv)</li>
      <li>JSON (.json)</li>
      <li>TSV (.tsv)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The default file format is JSON. To change the file format, simply expand the <i>Download Options</i> dropdown
      and click your desired option.</p>

    <h3>Deleting Responses</h3>

    <p>When on the review page, you can delete responses for your questionnaire that you do not wish to keep. You can
      delete all responses at once by clicking the <i>Delete Responses</i> button, or individually by clicking their
      respective <i>Delete</i> buttons on the individual view.</p>

    <p class="warning">
      Please note that responses cannot be recovered once they have been deleted. It is recommended that you
      back up your responses in case you need to access them again.
