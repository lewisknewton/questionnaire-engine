# Questionnaire Engine

A questionnaire engine coursework project for the Web Programming module (2019-2020).

Download a zip of this repository or clone it using:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/lewisknewton/webp-coursework
```

For development and testing, the application was run on the University of Portsmouth's [Virtual Machine Service](https://uop-1-server-per-student-prod.appspot.com/instance/get).

## Set-up

Navigate to the installation folder and run:
```bash
npm run setup
npm start
```

`npm run setup` will create the database and its tables. `npm start` will launch the application.

For testing purposes, the `example.json` file has been included in the questionnaires directory to provide an example questionnaire. A similar file, `another-example.json`, has been included within a sub-folder for the same reason.
